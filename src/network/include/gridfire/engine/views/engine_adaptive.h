     * @class AdaptiveEngineView
     * @brief An engine view that dynamically adapts the reaction network based on runtime conditions.
     *
     * This class implements an EngineView that dynamically culls species and reactions from the
     * full reaction network based on their reaction flow rates and connectivity. This allows for
     * efficient simulation of reaction networks by focusing computational effort on the most
     * important species and reactions.
     *
     * The AdaptiveEngineView maintains a subset of "active" species and reactions, and maps
     * between the full network indices and the active subset indices. This allows the base engine
     * to operate on the full network data, while the AdaptiveEngineView provides a reduced view
     * for external clients.
     *
     * The adaptation process is driven by the `update()` method, which performs the following steps:
     *   1. **Reaction Flow Calculation:** Calculates the molar reaction flow rate for each reaction
     *      in the full network based on the current temperature, density, and composition.
     *   2. **Reaction Culling:** Culls reactions with flow rates below a threshold, determined by
     *      a relative culling threshold multiplied by the maximum flow rate.
     *   3. **Connectivity Analysis:** Performs a connectivity analysis to identify species that are
     *      reachable from the initial fuel species through the culled reaction network.
     *   4. **Species Culling:** Culls species that are not reachable from the initial fuel.
     *   5. **Index Map Construction:** Constructs index maps to map between the full network indices
     *      and the active subset indices for species and reactions.
