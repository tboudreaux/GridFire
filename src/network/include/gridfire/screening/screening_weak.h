     * @return A vector of screening factors, one for each reaction.
     *
     * @b Algorithm
     * 1.  **Low-Temperature Cutoff**: If T9 is below a small threshold (1e-9),
     *     screening is effectively turned off to prevent numerical instability.
     * 2.  **Zeta Factor (ζ)**: A composition-dependent term is calculated:
     *     `ζ = ∑(Z_i² + Z_i) * Y_i`, where Z_i is the charge and Y_i is the
     *     molar abundance of species i.
     * 3.  **Prefactor**: A key prefactor is computed:
     *     `prefactor = 0.188 * sqrt(ρ / T₇³) * sqrt(ζ)`,
     *     where T₇ is the temperature in units of 10^7 K.
     * 4.  **Screening Term (H_12)**: For each reaction, the term H_12 is calculated:
     *     - For a two-body reaction (reactants Z₁ and Z₂): `H_12 = prefactor * Z₁ * Z₂`.
     *     - For the triple-alpha reaction (3 * He4): `H_12 = 3 * (prefactor * Z_α * Z_α)`.
     *     - For one-body reactions (decays), H_12 is 0, so the factor is 1.
     * 5.  **Capping**: The value of H_12 is capped at 2.0 to prevent excessively large
     *     and unphysical screening factors (exp(2) ≈ 7.4).
     * 6.  **Final Factor**: The screening factor for the reaction is `exp(H_12)`.
